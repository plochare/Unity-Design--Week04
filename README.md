# üé¨ Unity Animation System & Mixamo Integration

Animating characters brings your Unity projects to life.  
This guide covers **Unity‚Äôs Animation System** and provides a **hands-on workflow to import Mixamo animations**.

---

## üìå What is the Unity Animation System?

The **Unity Animation System** allows you to animate characters and objects using:

- **Keyframe Animation**: Manual animation inside Unity.
- **Imported Animations**: From tools like Mixamo, Blender, or Maya.
- **Animator Controller**: A state machine that manages multiple animations and transitions.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Animator Component** | Attaches to a GameObject to control animations. |
| **Animation Clip** | A single animation sequence (e.g., walk, run, jump). |
| **Animator Controller** | Organizes animation clips in states and transitions. |
| **Blend Trees** | Smoothly blend between multiple animations based on parameters. |
| **Root Motion** | Moves the GameObject in world space according to the animation. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Unity Animator Setup

1. **Add Animator Component**
   - Select your character in the **Hierarchy**.
   - Click **Add Component ‚Üí Animator**.
   - Create or assign an **Animator Controller**.

2. **Open Animator Controller**
   - Double-click the Animator Controller in **Project Window**.
   - Add states by dragging animation clips into the Animator.
   - Define **transitions** between states based on conditions like speed or triggers.

---

## üåê Using Mixamo Animations in Unity

**Mixamo** provides free rigged characters and pre-made animations. Follow these steps to integrate Mixamo animations into Unity.

### Step 1: Choose or Upload Character
1. Go to [Mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com/).
2. Select a character from the library or upload your own rigged character.

### Step 2: Pick Animations
1. Search for the desired animation (walk, run, jump, attack, etc.).
2. Click the animation to preview it in the Mixamo viewer.

### Step 3: Download Animation
1. Click **Download**.
2. Choose **FBX for Unity**.
3. Set **Pose ‚Üí T-Pose**.
4. Choose **With Skin** (for full character) or **Without Skin** (if adding only animation).

### Step 4: Import into Unity
1. Drag the downloaded FBX into **Assets** in Unity.
2. Select the FBX file, go to **Rig** tab, and set:
   - **Animation Type ‚Üí Humanoid**
   - Click **Apply**.
3. Unity automatically generates **Animation Clips** from the FBX.

### Step 5: Configure Animator Controller
1. Open your **Animator Controller**.
2. Drag the imported Animation Clips into the Animator window.
3. Create **transitions** between animations.
   - Example: Idle ‚Üí Walk ‚Üí Run
4. Add **parameters**:
   - Float: `Speed` for movement
   - Trigger: `Jump` for jump animation

### Step 6: Enable Root Motion (Optional)
- If the animation moves the character in world space (e.g., walking forward), check **Apply Root Motion** in the Animator.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Controlling Animations via Script

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class CharacterController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Animator animator;

    void Update()
    {
        float move = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        animator.SetFloat("Speed", move);

        if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump"))
        {
            animator.SetTrigger("Jump");
        }
    }
}
```

   - **Follow**: the object the camera moves with.
   - **Look At**: the object the camera points at.
4. Play the scene to see the camera follow and track the target dynamically.

---

## üéØ FreeLook Camera for Third-Person

- Create a FreeLook camera: `GameObject ‚Üí Cinemachine ‚Üí FreeLook Camera`.
- Set the **Follow** and **Look At** targets.
- Adjust **Rig Settings**:
  - **Top Rig / Middle Rig / Bottom Rig**: Control height and radius of orbits.
  - **Axis Control**: Adjust speed and responsiveness.
- Ideal for games like third-person adventure, platformers, and RPGs.

---

## üé¨ Dolly Tracks & Cinematics

1. Create a **Cinemachine Dolly Track**: `GameObject ‚Üí Cinemachine ‚Üí Dolly Track with Cart`.
2. Place **Waypoints** along the path.
3. Assign **Virtual Camera** to the **Dolly Cart**.
4. Animate the cart using **Timeline** for cinematic sequences or cutscenes.

---

## üìú Sample Script Control

You can switch cameras dynamically with C#:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Cinemachine;

public class CameraSwitcher : MonoBehaviour
{
    public CinemachineVirtualCamera cam1;
    public CinemachineVirtualCamera cam2;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Alpha1))
        {
            cam1.Priority = 10;
            cam2.Priority = 0;
        }
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Alpha2))
        {
            cam1.Priority = 0;
            cam2.Priority = 10;
        }
    }
}
```

- **Accelerometer**: Device tilt affects `Input.acceleration` in Unity.
- **Gyroscope**: Device rotation affects `Input.gyro` data.

**Example Script for Touch Input:**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class TouchExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.touchCount > 0)
        {
            Touch touch = Input.GetTouch(0);
            Vector3 worldPos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(touch.position);
            Debug.Log("Touch position: " + worldPos);
        }
    }
}
````

Attach this to a GameObject and see touch positions logged while using Unity Remote.

---

## üöÄ Tips

* Use **Unity Remote** early in development to quickly iterate on mobile UI and gameplay.
* Remember **performance will differ** from actual builds; use Unity Remote for input and layout testing only.

# Unity Multiplayer with Netcode for GameObjects üöÄ

Build scalable and fun multiplayer experiences in Unity using **Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)**. This guide introduces the basics of setting up a multiplayer project, creating networked players, and syncing game state across clients.

---

## üìñ Overview

Unity provides multiple networking solutions, but **Netcode for GameObjects** is the recommended starting point for small to mid-sized multiplayer games such as:

* Co-op adventures
* Competitive arena shooters
* Casual multiplayer experiences

**Key Features of NGO** :

* **NetworkObject** ‚Äì sync any GameObject across clients (spawn, despawn, ownership).
* **NetworkBehaviour** ‚Äì extend MonoBehaviour with networking capabilities.
* **NetworkVariables** ‚Äì synchronize data continuously across clients.
* **Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)** ‚Äì trigger events or actions remotely.
* **NetworkManager** ‚Äì central controller for connections, transport, and session management.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

* Unity **6.0 or higher** (LTS recommended)
* Add **Netcode for GameObjects** via **Package Manager**

  * Go to `Window > Package Manager` ‚Üí select **Unity Registry** ‚Üí install `Netcode for GameObjects` .

### 2. Add the **NetworkManager**

1. Create an empty GameObject ‚Üí add **NetworkManager** (`Netcode > NetworkManager`) .
2. Select a transport layer (e.g., **Unity Transport**).
3. Save the scene and add it to **Build Settings**.

---

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Player NetworkObjects

Each player is represented by a **Player NetworkObject** :

* Contains the **character controller** and player visuals.
* Stores and syncs **player-specific data** (name, score, inventory).
* Owned by the client who controls it.

üîß Setup:

1. Create a prefab of your player GameObject.
2. Add:

   * **NetworkObject**
   * **NetworkBehaviour** (for logic, variables, RPCs)
   * **NetworkTransform** (syncs movement)
   * **NetworkAnimator** (syncs animations)
3. Register the prefab in the **NetworkManager > Player Prefab** slot .

---

## üîÑ Synchronizing Data

### NetworkVariables

Best for **continuous state** (health, position, score):

```csharp
public class PlayerStats : NetworkBehaviour {
    public NetworkVariable<int> Health = new NetworkVariable<int>(100);

    public void TakeDamage(int amount) {
        if (IsServer) {
            Health.Value -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

### RPCs

Best for **discrete events** (shooting, ability use):

```csharp
[ServerRpc]
void ShootServerRpc(Vector3 position) {
    // Spawn bullet on server and sync across clients
}
```

üìå Use **NetworkVariables** for states, **RPCs** for events .

---

## üéÆ Testing Multiplayer

Unity 6 introduces **Multiplayer Play Mode (MPPM)** :

* Run multiple editor instances at once.
* Simulate host + clients without building separate executables.
* Configure under `Window > Multiplayer Play Mode`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Authority & Ownership

NGO is **server-authoritative** by default :

* **Server** controls spawning, despawning, and final state.
* Clients can **own objects** using `SpawnWithOwnership`.

Useful checks inside scripts:

* `IsServer` ‚Üí running on server
* `IsClient` ‚Üí running on client
* `IsOwner` ‚Üí current player owns this object
* `IsLocalPlayer` ‚Üí player object of this client

---

## üìä Handling Latency

Latency can cause **rubber-banding** and **desync**. Unity provides :

* **Client-side prediction & reconciliation**
* **Unity Transport Debug Simulator** ‚Üí simulate packet loss, jitter, lag
* **Interpolation & anticipation** for smoother gameplay
